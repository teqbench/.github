# TeqBench

## Overview

TeqBench is an application platform with multiple purpopses:

- To learn and utilize various technologies, including .NET, Angular, React, Azure, and GitHub.
- To acquire and apply software development best practices relevant to the technologies being used.
- To create and refine repository structures, achieving a high level of consistency across repositories, and adhering to best practices relevant to the technologies in use.
- To develop reusable elements, such as an overall GitHub organizational structure, actions/workflows, and repository templates, which can be leveraged for consulting work.

## Org Documentation

An organizational-level wiki is currently (1/15/24) not supported by GitHub. A workaround is to leverage the wiki feature of a repository. In the case of TeqBench, all general supporting documentation for the organization can be found in the [teqbench.docs](https://github.com/teqbench/teqbench.docs) repo, specifially, in the [teqbench.docs/wiki](https://github.com/teqbench/teqbench.docs/wiki). By keeping all documentation as part of the organization on GitHub, the content is centralized on a single platform (i.e. less to manage, immediately available and easily referenced as part of same platform.). One exception, sensitive information (i.e. trade secrets, passwords, etc.) should be managed in separate system all together and with multiple levels of access such as 2FA.
